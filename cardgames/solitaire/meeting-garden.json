    "setup": [
      "Choose your garden size (5×5 or 6×6 grid)",
      "The King of Hearts is placed in the top-left corner",
      "The Queen of Hearts is placed in the bottom-right corner",
      "All other spaces are filled with cards from the shuffled deck",

    "gameplay": [
      "Remove pairs of cards that match by SUIT or RANK",
      "Matching cards must be adjacent (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) OR separated by exactly one card",
      "When you remove cards, empty spaces are immediately filled from the stock pile",
      "Once the stock is empty, the grid compresses: all cards (including King and Queen) slide toward the top-left to fill gaps",
      "This compression physically moves the King and Queen closer together",
      "Mobile Controls: Pinch with two fingers to zoom. Drag with two fingers to pan the board.",
      "Optional Suitor Rule: Other Kings and Queens can 'block' the meeting if they end up adjacent to your protagonists"
