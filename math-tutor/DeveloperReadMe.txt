Summary
When providing documentation to AI for new visualizations:

✅ Provide core/python-engine.js
✅ Provide developer-guide.html (this document)
❌ Do NOT need to provide index.html
❌ Do NOT need to provide tutor-engine.js (just mention to update system prompt)
❌ Do NOT need to provide manifest.json
❌ Do NOT need to provide CSS files
❌ Do NOT need to provide language-manager.js or message-parser.js

But really, yes, include the tutor-engine.js as well if you get stuck editing it.
